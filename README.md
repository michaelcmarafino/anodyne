## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The core fundamentals of the web were used to make this site.  It shows how you don't always need the latest framework to make experiences for the web that help businesses grow.  


## Optimizations

I would build out the rest of the pages to show potential clients that this can be a multipage application.  Also, I could add an admin login and backend so the site owner could make changes to the content on their own.

## Lessons Learned:

How to build out a beautiful web page.  Using the core functionalities of these languages has given me a better grasp on all of them and understand the need for other tools that are popular in the industry.
